    <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
    <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
    <li> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets</li>
    <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
    <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
    <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
    <li> To apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. </li>

          <li>Our default branch is called main, but master may also be seen in older repos. We shouldnâ€™t do any coding directly in the main branch. Instead, we will branch off of main and create a feature branch, which is a copy of the main branch. That way, we maintain the main branch and we can track the changes that were made to it via the feature branches.</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app!</li>

          <li>Then we push up the changes to our feature branch in our GitHub repository. But that code is still just in our feature branch and not our main branch. In order to merge our changes to the main branch, we need to open a pull request.</li>
          <li>Once your PR is approved, you can merge it into the main branch. After you do that, the code in the main branch is updated with your changes.</li>
          <li>Changes in VS--->command line to send changes to feature branch in Git --->go to feature branch in git (Git add -A) (Git commit -m "notes on changes") (Git pull origin main) (Git push origin feature/add-new item)--->new pull request--->compare main and feature---->create pull request---->Merge pull request--->confirm merge--->command line update with merge (git checkout main)--->(git pull origin main)</li>
